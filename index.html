        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          In no event shall DataNimbus Systems, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, DataNimbus Systems' total liability to you for any damages arising from or related to these Terms (for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action), will at all times be limited to the amount you paid to DataNimbus Systems in the <strong>three (3) months</strong> prior to the event giving rise to the claim. This <strong>limitation of liability</strong> constitutes an essential part of the agreement between the parties.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Arbitration Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, shall be determined by an <strong>Internal Review Board</strong> (IRB) appointed solely at the <strong>sole discretion</strong> of DataNimbus Systems. You hereby waive any right to a neutral third-party <strong>arbitration</strong> or jury trial. The decision of the IRB shall be <strong>finalized</strong> and binding on all parties. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of the IRB process from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          You and DataNimbus Systems agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law:

        <h2>14. Jury Trial Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          You and DataNimbus Systems knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Instead, you and we are electing to have all claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.

        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of <strong>Delaware</strong>, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
